# ProgressBar

## Usage
One of the most important rules in UI / UX design is visibility of system state. The goal behind this rule is pretty obvious: To minimize user stress, you need to provide them with feedback on what is going on with the app within a reasonable amount of time. Don't let users guess, tell them what's going on. And one of the most common forms of this type of feedback is a progress indicator.

### Types of Progress bars
**Determinate:** when indicators are determinate they indicate how long an operation will take when the percentage complete is detectable.

**Indeterminate**: when indicators are indeterminate they request that the user waits while something finishes when itâ€™s not necessary to indicate how long it will take.

## Playground

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Standard">
    {args => {
      return <ProgressBar {...args} />;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Standard" />

## Variation on color

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Size">
    {args => {
      return (
        <>
          <ProgressBar {...args} percent={25} color="#67b373"/>
          <ProgressBar {...args} percent={50} color="#f9b53f"/>
          <ProgressBar {...args} percent={75} color="#5992c7"/>
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Variation on height

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Height">
    {args => {
      return (
        <>
          <ProgressBar {...args} percent={50} height="small"/>
          <ProgressBar {...args} percent={50} height="large"/>
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
